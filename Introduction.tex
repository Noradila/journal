%CHALLENGES AND ISSUES
\IEEEPARstart{W}{ireless} sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used in various kinds of applications to collect data and measurements data from the sensors. 
The sensors are mainly deployed to track and monitor in different types of environments such as on the land, underground and underwater for continuous sensing, event detection, location sensing and other control over the different components of the sensing device. 
It is increasingly important to have reliable and energy efficient WSNs that could function for years as sensors are easily deployed in areas that are difficult to reach such as for volcanic monitoring, forest fire detection and flood detection.

%problem statement
However, sensors suffer from limited hardware resources which only allow limited computational functionalities to be performed. Sensors also suffer from limited energy capacities as they are battery powered and will not able to function once the certain threshold of energy level is reached. 
Sensors also operate in an unreliable radio environment that is noisy and error prone which drain the sensors batteries at a higher rate. These constraints have a major impact on the sensors performance. 
In order to cope with the sensors limitations, the protocol should be able to use many reliably channels for communications to reduce the effect of interference and energy consumption, and to have an optimal energy-based routing to prolong the sensors and overall network lifetime.
Many energy efficient protocols have been proposed in term of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols and routing protocols that show promising results in overcoming the problems but none is widely implemented yet.

%WSNs could help to enable automated services in smart cities to improve the environment quality, increase the energy saving and improve the lifestyle as WSNs simplify and reduce manual and labour work to automated systems. This is because sensors can be densely deployed, easy to install and require minimal maintenance over a period of time. 

%Many energy efficient protocols have been proposed in term of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, routing protocols, power control and energy harvesting to overcome the problems of interference to maximise the throughput and the sensors energy to prolong the network lifetime. 



%MAC and routing protocols are the main protocols that control the network energy consumption to allow the network to remain functional for a longer period of time. While the other proposed solutions could increase the sensors residual energy, the energy saving depends on the MAC and routing protocols.
%There have been many proposals in multichannel MAC protocols that show promising results but none is widely implemented yet. 
%In MAC protocol, the energy consumption can be reduced by adjusting the radio duty cycle to allow the sensors to be in the sleep mode when they are not used and to transmit on channels that have less interference to increase the likeliness of data success.

%our solution in brief
Multichannel cross-layer routing protocol (MCRP\footnotemark) is a multichannel protocol that considers all available channels in the spectrum. The protocol is partly distributed where the nodes work independently with a centralised controller, low power border router (LPBR) that has the intelligence to analyse and provide control decisions over the channels in the network. MCRP helps to increase the overall throughput by using interference free or minimal interference channels for communications.
%, however it does not consider the sensors lifetime during the decision making process. 
In order to optimise the network lifespan while ensuring high throughput through multichannel, the energy-based tree reconfiguration is proposed. It is aimed to extend the current WSN lifetime by finding the optimal tree through routes swapping of the sensor with the minimum residual energy to other alternative paths. 

%our evaluation shows that
The experimental results show that MCRP demonstrates high throughput of nearly 100\% as it is able to detect and avoid from using the channels with high interference for communications
%compared to Orchestra, an existing multichannel protocol that has an average of 70\% reception rate 
in Cooja emulation. MCRP also shows high throughput values of 80\%-90\% in the real world environments where the experiments took place in an office (university) and residential environments to prove that MCRP provides high packet reception rate regardless of the locations that may have different channels occupancy. 
%Multichannel 
MCRP also improves the energy efficiency as it consumes 3 times less energy than a single channel during communications.
In the optimal tree reconfiguration, the experiments show an increase of 8.3 times than the initial lifetime of 0.3\% through routes swap.

%%Multichannel helps to increase the overall throughput by using interference free or minimal interference channels, however it does not consider the sensors lifetime during the decision making process. Multichannel routing tree optimisation is introduced which aims to extend the WSN lifetime by switching the routes that use the sensor with the minimum residual energy from their initial paths to other paths which from the experiments show an increase in the lifetime of the network by 8.3 times than the initial lifetime of 0.3\%.
